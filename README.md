# GALSIM Iterator

This is the code suite test environment to ultimately be used for
*DES Final Photometry: Supernova Fluxes*
by Dillon Brout: dbrout@physics.upenn.edu.

Images are located in /global/scratch2/sd/dbrout/SN_images/

PROGRESS:
=========

TO DO LIST:
-----------
* Check that it is correctly on top of a galaxy

* Need to convert galpos_ra and galpos_dec from sky pos to pixels
* Allow GalsimKernel to accept arrays of galpos_ra's and decs
* Double check stamp to see if it is correctly centered on galaxy

* figure out how to ravel the Galsim image
* Implement pixelize image
* pixelize real image
* Understand RA vs DEC in images
* figure out how to iterate
* Implement adjust_model()
* How do I get the galaxy positions???
* How do i know which images are pre-post SN?
